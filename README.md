# CS-4550-HW6
Work off previous WebGL 2.0 3D object that is rotatable using the arrow keys (refer to CS-4550-HW5) with an added texture.

To make sure the shape is rendered properly, navigate to the directory where the HTML and image files are and run 'python -m http.server 8000'. Then, enter localhost:8000 into a browser where you should be able to see all the files within the directory. Click on 'HW6A' to see the shape.
