For this program, we started with the base shape and functionality from the prior homework assignment. Rotation will begin with an arrow key press and will stop when any other arrow is pressed.  We also removed the use of the modfied Phong lighting model for the 3D object's ligthing and shading as we will be using texture mapping instead. It was decided that using an external image for texture would be our method. We referred to the sample code of textureCube as a guide for the mapping. We also calculate the shape's position after rotating within the vertex shader and use of an eventListener. In order for us to apply our texture onto our 3D object, we initalize an array for the texture coordinates and corners of our shape. We then pass the texture coordinates as aTexCoord to the vertex shader where we add the texture coordinate attribute, rotate and output the texture coordinates as vTexCoord. The output is interpolated by the rasterized are sent to the fragment shader. In order to bind the texture, we use the sampler2D variable type to bind the texture to our shape and determine each color of the texel.
